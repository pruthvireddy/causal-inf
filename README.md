## Notes
- Experience in applying at least one of the following in your research: survey methodology (e.g., bias correction, sampling and design), quantitative research methods or statistical analysis, regression modeling, causal inference with a survey outcome, shrinkage and regularization, designing and analyzing longitudinal panel surveys, behavioral data analysis
- Experience with data analysis using tools such as R or Python and with SQL
- Experience initiating and driving research projects to completion with minimal guidance
- Experience communicating the results of analyses
- Must obtain work authorization in country of employment at the time of hire, and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment

**Preferred Qualification**

- Experience with large data sets and distributed computing (Hive/Hadoop)
- Experience with Bayesian statistical models
- Experience with primary data collection
- Experience with field experiments, experimental design, missing data, survey sampling, and/or panel data
- Experience with observational causal inference (e.g., regression adjustment, matching, propensity score stratification), or quasi-experimental methods (e.g., instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, interrupted time series)
- Experience with bandit optimization, adaptive experimentation, and/or Gaussian processes
